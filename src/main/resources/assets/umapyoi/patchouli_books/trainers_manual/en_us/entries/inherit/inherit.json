The higher the level, the more likely a Factor is to be effectively inherited, and the greater the number of Factors that can be effectively inherited, the greater the likelihood that they will be effectively inherited. $(p) Factor Inheritance can break through the upper limit of the original Umamusume Soul's ability, bringing it to a whole new level. This is something that is difficult to achieve with the training process. That's why experienced trainers value both training and inheritance."
